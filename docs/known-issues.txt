If Archi does not load and shows an error dialog
------------------------------------------------

When trying to launch Archi you may see a dialog box stating "An error has occurred." 

If this happens you need to delete the "config" folder and restart Archi.

- On Windows, the "config" folder is located at "<user home>/AppData/Roaming/Archi/config"
- On Mac, the "config" folder is located at "<user home>/Library/Application Support/Archi/config"
- On Linux, the "config" folder is located at "<user home>/.archi/config"


If the content of the "Welcome" window does not display, maximize the "Welcome" window and click on the
"Home" button on the "Welcome" window's toolbar.
